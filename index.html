                the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inpired me to one day
                go for and work and work with the apple when I get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve 
                Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he's a great
                man and I will never forget him. </p><br>

            <p class="bio">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life?. Every short story I've written as adult (and certainly everyone
                that has been published), almost every email I've written, has been written on machines created by Apple.
                I interacted online using Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realise 
                that star Trek future I dreamed of a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realise my own. You'll
                be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p><br>
